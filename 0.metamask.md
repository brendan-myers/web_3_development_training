# Create wallet in Metamask

## Download Metamask

Download Metamask, a crypto wallet implemented as a browser extension.

1. Download the extension for [Chrome](https://metamask.io/). To be extra nice you can also use the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) (optional).

1. Go through the setup process for a wallet in Metamask. Write down your recovery phrase, especially if you want to use Metamask for real.

**Note**: The best practice is to never share private key with others.

## Create a second Account

Create a second account. We will use this account to test out transfer, smart contract ownership and so on.

## Enable and switch to Rinkeby Testnet

The workshop will be performed on the Rinkeby Testnet, so it is important to switch to it now.

Click on the Network selection, then Show/hide test networks, enable test networks.

Then click on network selection again and select Rinkeby Testnet. You should select the Testnet as below:

You should also note down the address of both Accounts created:
```
Account 1: 0x123456...
Account 2: 0xabcdef...
```

On the next section, we will explore on how to do basic ethereum transaction on the testnet.

# Operating on the testnets

Etherscan has a separate version for Rinkeby Testnet [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/).

The next step is to get some testnet ether from the [Rinkeby faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/). On that site, insert the address for one of your Account. At the time of writing, Rinkeby will give out 0.1 testnet eth:

Once the faucet gave you some ether, verify the transaction and account in [Rinkeby EtherScan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/) - also verify that you see ether in your wallet.

Initiate the transfer between your accounts (Or optionally to another account). Verify after the transaction:

- What is the transaction on Etherscan
- How much was the gas fee

A good tool to check for unit conversion and gas price is[Ether Converter](https://eth-converter.com/) and [Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/).

Next up, let's configure [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), an online IDE for Smart Contract and deploy some smart contract.
